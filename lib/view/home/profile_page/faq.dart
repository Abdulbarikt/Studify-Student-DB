 Studify will ask permission to access your device address book so you can see your contacts who also use  Studify

Displaying contacts correctly:
Make sure that your contacts have active  Studify accounts
Save the contact details in your device address book with proper formats
Where possible, use the use the full international format: + [country/region code] [full phone number].
Remove any leading zero or special calling codes.
Ensure you accept the  Studify contact permission request (or go to your device settings and enable it)
If your device address book allows, ensure that all accounts and groups are set to "visible" or "viewable".
Blocking Contacts
Blocking contacts will prevent you from receiving calls or messages from them:

Blocking Contacts: go to Profile -> Settings -> Account ->Privacy
To un-block, follow the same flow and select the contact to un-block
Note: A blocked contact will still show in your address book.
